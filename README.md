This is the master folder of all the code I have developed during my time working at the Johns Hopkins Locomotion in Mechanical and Biological Systems Lab.
My main task was to interpolate and correct tracking data from raw video files by generating commands for an machine learning software, Deeplabcut, and 
correcting the tracking data and expand the interpolated points as 12 evenly spaced points along the fish's body.
